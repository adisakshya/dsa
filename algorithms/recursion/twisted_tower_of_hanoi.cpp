/**
 * Twisted Tower of Hanoi (Recursive)
 * 
 * Twisted Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.
 * The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
 *      1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 *      2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack
 *          i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
 *      3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 *      4) No disk can be moved directly from first rod to last rod
 * 
 * Complexity
 *      Time: 
 *          Worst Case: 3^N
 *      Space: O(N)
 *
